### How did that old saying go again?

> **"She loves me, she..."**

The words elude me, lost to the wind alongside any warmth I had held onto. My shivers keep my pen shaky, splattering ink on my notebook, and yet I must write.

~Do you remember her name?~

~Do you recall her face?~

~She must have been beautiful.~

~Much like the sun.~
