### How did that old saying go again?

> **"She loves me, she..."**

The words elude me, lost to the wind alongside any warmth I had held onto. My shivers keep my pen shaky, splattering ink on my notebook, and yet I must write.

<sub>Do you remember her name?</sub>

<sub>Do you recall her face?</sub>

<sub>She must have been beautiful.</sub>


<sub>Much like the sun.</sub>
